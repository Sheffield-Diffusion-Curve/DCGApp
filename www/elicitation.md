It is not the purpose of this page to describe the rationale behind expert elicitation or identify best practice; this has been done previously, most notably by Tony O’Hagan and colleagues (see first reference below).  We do, however, flag up other materials and resources that can help the beginner apply the methods in a way that allows them to use our diffusion curve generator

#### Best overall text on expert elicitation

Anthony O'Hagan, Caitlin E. Buck, Alireza Daneshkhah, J. Richard Eiser, Paul H. Garthwaite, David J. Jenkinson, Jeremy E. Oakley, Tim Rakow.  Uncertain Judgements: Eliciting Experts' Probabilities.  Wiley, 2006.  ISBN: 978-0-470-02999-2

#### Software and supporting information relating to this book

The Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF) was developed from the work underpinning the O’Hagan book.  SHELF is available at:
(http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/shelf/)

An online elicitation tool based on SHELF was developed and is described in:

Morris D, Oakley J, Crowe J.  A web-based tool for eliciting probability distributions from experts. Environmental Modelling & Software 2014;52:1-4.

The tool described in that paper can be found here:

#### Elicitation of N1, t’ and m

A detailed description of the elicitation task used to identify the probability distributions for N1, t’ and m by Sabine Grimm for her 2018 paper can be found in her doctoral thesis:

Grimm S. Identifying potentially effective implementation strategies for EIS in PTB screening.  In: Incorporating technology diffusion estimates in health economic methods.  Sheffield: University of Sheffield, 2016. Available at: http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13948/1/Thesis_SG_final_corrected_final.pdf

To allow the quick generation of diffusion curves, we have included triangular distributions to be specified for N1, m and t’.  These are much simpler to generate from informal discussions with experts, however, these unstructured methods will be prone to the biases identified by O’Hagan and colleagues.

#### Training

The University of Sheffield runs a one-day short course on expert elicitation.  The course is run by researchers from Health Economics and Decision Science (HEDS) and the School of Mathematics and Statistics (SoMAS).  Go to the ScHARR Short Course Unit website for dates: (https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/shortcourseunit).

An e-learning course, entitled "Probabilistic Judgements for Expert Elicitation" is available via the SHELF website (http://www.tonyohagan.co.uk/shelf/). The course is free and takes around two hours to complete.
