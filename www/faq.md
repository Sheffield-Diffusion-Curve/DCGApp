### Do you track users?
We count the number of people visiting our homepage, as shown by the page counter.  We also count the number of times the DCG is run.  And nothing else.
We do not collect any information on IP addresses.
We do not collect any information on your parameter inputs.
We do not collect any information on your outputs.

### Has the original method in Grimm et al (2018) been altered for the online tool?
Yes, three changes have been implemented.  These are:

- Choice of pooling method
- Alternative curve fitting procedure
- Alternative method for calculating diffusion curves for centiles

Further details of these changes can be found via the DCG methods tab.

### Which method of expert elicitation should I use?
The distribution and parameters used within our original work used the tercile method set within the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF).  These values were elicited from individual interviews with three experts and combined through linear aggregation.
However, we would not consider this to be the ‘best method’; in general, group elicitation is preferred, whilst the method used for the derivation of distribution and parameters is more open to debate.  The choice of method needs to be made carefully, taking into consideration your own requirements and constraints. Piloting is essential.
For further information on elicitation methods go to our Elicitation page.

### Are any other distributions available for expert elicitation?
Whilst the use of other distributions is possible, we have focused on those available within SHELF and the MATCH Uncertainty Elicitation Tool.  We have added a triangular distribution to allow for the quick specification of values from informal discussions, but we would not recommend this as a method for generating robust results.


### Can I generate the results using the original method in Grimm et al (2018)?
The original methods can not be generated using this online tool.  The original methods can be implemented outside this tool by following the description given in the journal article.

### How are the time horizon and time intervals derived?
You don’t need to know…but you can override this and specify your own.

### Can an alternative time horizon or time intervals be chosen?
Yes.

### Can I request changes to the DCG?
Yes, contact us.  But we may not be able to do it.

Or [Bugs report](https://github.com/Sheffield-Diffusion-Curve/DCGApp/issues).

### Can I get the code that sits beneath the DCG?
This is freely available via Github.  Search for Sheffield-Diffusion-Curve

### Has a description of the tool been published in a journal?
We will be submitting this to a journal in the near future.

### How should I report the use of the tool in a paper?
Clearly, this is ultimately up to you.  It must meet the requirements of the publisher, but we would suggest that you cite the original paper (Grimm et al, 2018) that developed the method and which is peer reviewed.  The URL for the tool should also be cited.

### How quick is the DCG?
Very quick. It will run in around 1 second for 1000 re-samples. If its performance drops much below this, please let us know.
