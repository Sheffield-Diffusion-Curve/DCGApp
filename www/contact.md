### Bibliographyâ€¦.citation search results and case studies 
If you use the model, the software should be cited.  The format will vary from journal to journal, however, the APA style for it is:

Diffusion Curve Generator, Release 1.0 [Computer software]. (2018). Retrieved from http://dcg.shef.ac.uk
The paper that reports the original method and case study is:

- Grimm SE, Stevens JW, Dixon S.  Estimating Future Health Technology Diffusion Using Expert Beliefs Calibrated to an Established Diffusion Model.  Value Health. 2018 Aug;21(8):944-950. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.010.

A fuller description of the work, including the elicitation exercise can be found at:

- Grimm S. Identifying potentially effective implementation strategies for EIS in PTB screening.  In: Incorporating technology diffusion estimates in health economic methods.  Sheffield: University of Sheffield, 2016. Available at: http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/13948/1/Thesis_SG_final_corrected_final.pdf

In addition to this, an application of this method has been published in relation to its use in cost-effectiveness analysis:

- Grimm SE, Dixon S, Stevens JW. When Future Change Matters: Modeling Future Price and Diffusion in Health Technology Assessments of Medical Devices. Value Health. 2016 Sep - Oct;19(6):720-726. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2016.06.002.

We are in the process of writing a paper describing this curve generation tool; a link to this paper will be given here as soon as it exists.  Periodically, we will be undertaking a search for all papers that cite this paper or the original paper by Grimm et al.  We will list these citations on this page.
If you publish or present anything that uses our DCG tool, please let us know.
